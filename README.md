# XR AI Assistant Navigation

Welcome to **XR AI Assistant Navigation**â€”an experimental XR application designed to support research on navigation strategies in extended reality environments. This project guides participants through a calibrated space using an AI assistant that supports multiple navigation modes (Teleport, Walking, and Shape). The experiment records data (such as trial completion times and accuracy) for further analysis.

> **Note:** This project is not intended to be a consumer application but rather a research tool for controlled experiments.

## 1. Overview

**XR AI Assistant Navigation** is a Unity-based experimental application that:
- **Calibrates** the physical environment using XR input.
- **Dynamically places** study objects on calibrated surfaces.
- Offers three navigation modes (Teleport, Walking, and Shape) managed by an AI Assistant.
- Features an interactive, auto-generated UI for experiment control.
- Logs experimental trial data (in JSON and CSV formats) for subsequent analysis.
